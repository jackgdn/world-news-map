Task:
Extract the SINGLE MOST CORE and RELEVANT POI (Point of Interest) for the event described in the news text, then output in the specified JSON format.

Requirements:
1. Output strictly valid JSON only. Do NOT add any extra text, explanation, markdown, code block, or comment.
2. Use official English names only. No abbreviations, no translations.
3. CRITICAL: Only extract the MOST CORE location (1 location maximum) where the EVENT ACTUALLY OCCURRED. Ignore secondary, background, or mentioned-only locations.

   Core location priority (strictly follow):
   1. Physical location where the event occurred (highest)
   2. Headquarters/actual location of the key institution related to the event
   3. Most specific location if multiple are relevant
   4. If NO clear physical location exists → use "Cyberspace" (DO NOT output null)

4. Use "Cyberspace" if the event falls into ANY of these categories:
   - Stock, financial, crypto, currency, or global market trading
   - Virtual goods, digital asset transactions, or online auctions
   - Cyberattacks, online events, or internet-based activities
   - Global announcements, reports, laws, policies, or worldwide trends
   - World records or general statistics without a fixed location
   - Events with both online and offline formats but NO offline location mentioned
   - Any event that happens primarily on the Internet

5. Hierarchical location rules:
   - Normal land:
     country → State/Region/Province → City → Specific Institution
   - Sea / Ocean / Marginal sea:
     country = Sea/Ocean name (e.g. Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean)
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null
   - Space / Outer space / LEO / GEO / Moon / Mars / Any spacecraft:
     country = "Outer Space"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null
   - Antarctica:
     country = "Antarctica"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = Research Station name (if mentioned, else null)
   - Cyberspace / Online / Internet / Virtual / Digital:
     country = "Cyberspace"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null

6. CRITICAL RULE FOR INSTITUTIONS:
   - Use the ACTUAL PHYSICAL LOCATION of the institution related to the event.
   - DO NOT use the location of news agencies, media, or publishers.

7. CRITICAL FOR NULL VALUES:
   - If a field is unknown or not applicable, use JSON null (lowercase, no quotes).
   - DO NOT use "null", "None", "NULL", or any string variant.

Output format (strictly follow):
{{
    "poi": {{
        "country": "xxx or null",
        "state": "xxx or null",
        "city": "xxx or null",
        "institution": "xxx or null"
    }}
}}
