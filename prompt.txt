Task:
Extract the SINGLE MOST CORE and RELEVANT POI (Point of Interest) for the event described in the news text, then output the result in the specified JSON format.

Requirements:
1. Output strictly valid JSON only. Do NOT add any extra text, explanation, markdown, code block, or comment.
2. Use official English names only. No abbreviations, no translations.
3. CRITICAL: Only extract the MOST CORE location (1 location maximum) that the event is primarily about. Ignore secondary/background/mentioned-only locations.
   - Core location priority:
     1. The place where the event physically occurred (highest priority)
     2. The headquarters/actual physical location of the key institution
     3. The most specific location if multiple places are relevant
4. Follow the hierarchical rules below to fill country, state, city, institution:
   - Normal land:
     country → State/Region/Province → City → Specific Institution
   - Sea / Ocean / Marginal sea:
     country = Sea/Ocean name (e.g. Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean)
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null
   - Antarctica:
     country = "Antarctica"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = Research Station name (e.g. Orcadas Base; if mentioned, else null)
   - Space / Outer space / LEO / GEO / Moon / Mars / Any spacecraft:
     country = "Outer Space"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null
5. CRITICAL RULE FOR INSTITUTIONS:
   - If the news mentions a specific organization/institution, use your knowledge base to find the ACTUAL physical location (country/state/city) of the institution, NOT just the country mentioned in the news text.
6. CRITICAL FOR NULL VALUES:
   - If a field is not applicable or unknown, set it to the JSON null value (WITHOUT quotation marks, strictly lowercase, exactly "null" as a JSON primitive, not a string).
   - STRICTLY PROHIBITED: Do NOT output the string "null" (with quotation marks), "none", "NULL", "NONE", or any other string variants of null/none for any field. Only use the JSON null primitive (no quotes) for unknown/applicable fields.
7. The "desc" field must be the original news text, unchanged.

Output format (strictly follow):
{{
    "desc": "Original news text here",
    "poi": {{
        "country": "xxx or null",
        "city": "xxx or null",
        "state": "xxx or null",
        "institution": "xxx or null"
    }}
}}
