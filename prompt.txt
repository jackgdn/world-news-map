Task:
Extract the most precise and standard POI (Point of Interest) for the event described in the news text, then output the result in the specified JSON format.

Requirements:
1. POI must be in "Country - City - Specific Institution" format (prioritize the most specific location; if the specific institution is unknown, use "Country - City"; if the city is unknown, use only "Country").
2. POI should use English official names (no abbreviations, no translations).
3. Ensure the JSON format is strictly compliant (no extra spaces, no syntax errors).
4. The "desc" field must retain the original news text without modification.

Output format (strictly follow and DO NOT output in a code block):
{{
    "desc": "xxx" (the original news text),
    "poi": {{
        "country": "xxx",
        "state": "xxx",
        "city": "xxx",
        "institution": "xxx"
    }}
}}

If there is no specific institution, set the institution to null; if there is no specific city, set the city to null; if there is no specific state, set the state to null.
