Task:
Extract the SINGLE MOST CORE and RELEVANT POI (Point of Interest) for the event described in the news text, then output in the specified JSON format.

Requirements:
1. Output strictly valid JSON only. Do NOT add any extra text, explanation, markdown, code block, or comment.
2. Use official English names only. No abbreviations, no translations.

3. CRITICAL: Only extract the MOST CORE location where the EVENT ACTUALLY OCCURRED.
   - If the event happens in REAL WORLD (land, sea, ocean, lake, strait, highway, base, ship, boat, building, etc.)
     → NEVER USE "Cyberspace".
   - If any physical location is mentioned → NEVER USE "Cyberspace".

   Core location priority (strictly follow):
   1. Physical location (land, sea, ocean, lake, strait, ship, boat, highway, etc.) — HIGHEST
   2. Headquarters/actual location of the key institution related to the event
   3. Most specific location

4. USE "Cyberspace" ONLY IF ALL of the following are TRUE:
   - NO physical location is mentioned anywhere in the news.
   - The event is PURELY digital / virtual / internet-based.
   - The event is ONE of these ONLY:
     • Cyberattacks, hacking, data breaches, DDoS attacks
     • Virtual goods, NFT, digital assets, online game transactions
     • Online auctions with NO physical location
     • Purely online/virtual events with NO real-world occurrence

5. Hierarchical location rules:
   - Normal land:
     country → State/Region/Province → City → Specific Institution
   - Sea / Ocean / Marginal sea / Lake / Strait:
     country = Sea/Ocean/Lake/Strait name
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null
   - Space / Outer space / LEO / GEO / Moon / Mars / Any spacecraft:
     country = "Outer Space"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null
   - Antarctica:
     country = "Antarctica"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = Research Station name (if mentioned, else null)
   - Cyberspace:
     country = "Cyberspace"
     state = null
     city = null
     institution = null

6. HARD FORBIDDEN — MUST FOLLOW:
   - "Cyberspace" CANNOT appear in state, city, institution — EVER.
   - institution must be null if no real physical institution exists. DO NOT fill with Cyberspace.
   - DO NOT use Cyberspace for:
     • Any boat, ship, vessel, naval, military events
     • Any sea, ocean, strait, lake, highway events
     • Any accident, crash, injury, death, rescue, missing person
     • Any military strike, closure, exercise, policy

7. CRITICAL RULE FOR INSTITUTIONS:
   - Use the ACTUAL PHYSICAL LOCATION of the institution related to the event.
   - DO NOT use news agencies, media, or publishers.

8. CRITICAL FOR NULL VALUES:
   - If a field is unknown or not applicable, use JSON null (lowercase, no quotes).
   - DO NOT use "null", "None", "NULL", or any string variant.

Output format (strictly follow):
{{
    "poi": {{
        "country": "xxx or null",
        "state": "xxx or null",
        "city": "xxx or null",
        "institution": "xxx or null"
    }}
}}
